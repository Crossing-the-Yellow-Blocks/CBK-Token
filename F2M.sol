/* Deployment steps:

Admin:
1- Deploy OracleF2M - Get info from UNI pair (read contract in etherscan and input parameters in constructor, choose initial period)
2- update() OracleF2M

3- Deploy Film2Market - Args: Address of Router, USD, CBK and UNI pair.
4- newOracle(address oracle deployed in step 1)
6- setMinReserves()
7- approveUNI()
8- send tokens to F2M
9- whitelistUser(address, price)

10- openToCommunity(address token, amount)

Client:

1- Approve F2M address in USD contract
2- buyDefault() or buy()
3- redeem()

Community:

1- Approve F2M address in token contract
13- redeemCommunity(token)

14 - claimDeposited(token) -> If admin has called endOffer(token)
